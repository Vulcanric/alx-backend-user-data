# 0x00. Personal data
**`Back-end`**  **`Authentification`**<br>
In this project, I worked with user data, implementing the following use cases:
- Processing of Personally Indentifiable Information (PII) and/or Personal Data.
- Implementing a logging system, obfuscating PII fields.
- Password encryption and validation.
- Authentication to database via environment variables.
